The following analysis of an avocado production/distribution dataset reveals several meaningful statistics relating to the price, volume, and shipment sizes of avocados from numerous U.S. regions.

The graphs located near the end of my analysis in JupyterLab show the following:

* The standard deviation of the total volume of avocados is much higher than the mean, and is increasing every year. A high std. indicates that the variability found in the total volume is growing.
* The table and bar plot containing the three bag sizes, grouped by the two types (organic and conventional), show that the number of small avocado bags in the "conventional" category is the largest metrics, while all of the rest are far smaller. The number of X-large bags in both categories are inconsequentially small.
* Lastly, the scatter plot of total volume vs. average price points shows that a large cluster of points fall before an average price of 2.5 and a total volume of 1e7 (10,000,000). There are a few outliers that go beyond these, but there are not very many.
